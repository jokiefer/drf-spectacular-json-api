### Fixed

- title and description translation for all relevant fields

### Changed

## [0.1.1] - 2023-03-02

### Fixed

- removes id from the sparse fieldset query parameters.
- lookup of id field is solved by analyzing the model and then getting the serializer field_name of the detected pk name to resolve the id schema. If no primary key could be detectet, the arbitrary-type is used as schema for the id field.

## [0.1.0] - 2023-02-23

### Added

- initial drf_spectacular_jsonapi app which is based on the drf_spectacular project and patches the basic json:api specific stuff. Basicly the component schemas are representing valid json:api resource objects and the basic query parameters are transported to the schema.
- added general project files such as LICENCE, CHANGELOG, README.
- added python specific project files such as setup.py, requirements and django based test suite.
